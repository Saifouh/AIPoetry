A neural network-based text generator that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture to generate text inspired by Shakespeare's works. The model is trained on a subset of Shakespeare's writings. This project provides an engaging demonstration of character-level text generation using TensorFlow and Keras.
